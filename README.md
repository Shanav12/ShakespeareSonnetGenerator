# ShakespeareSonnetGenerator

This project consists of a GPT-Neo model built using a plethora of Python libaries. 
All of the libaries used in this training process can be found in the Colab notebook found in the model_training folder.
The shakespeare.txt file is the dataset that I used to train the model.
